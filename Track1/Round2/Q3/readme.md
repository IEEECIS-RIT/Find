# Question:
"I Open at the close" ,you can see this when you go on this path. Most are terrified of it and everyone experiences it only once in their life…..?!


## Answer:

Road behind the Architecture building.
“I Open at the close” is a line from Harry potter.
It means that Harry’s snitch will open when he is near to death.
So, there is a path in the campus where you can see the dead. Also,the other clue clearly says most people are terrified of death.
From the road behind the architecture building you can see the Human anatomy section of the medical college, where dead people are placed for the study.
