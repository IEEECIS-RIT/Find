Step 1: You will find a Java file drive link in Inspect Element.

Step 2: When you run the JAVA file it will ask you a value of N. The value of N is 8.
Its the same value you get when you solve the first question of the first round.
The link for the first round is: https://find-track1.netlify.app

Step 3: When you type 8 and run the file. You will get 
    4.444.8.44.88.22. You have to decode this. 
To decode this there is a hint given in the JAVA file.
The hint is 555.444.22.777.2.777.999. : LIBRARY . This resembles the nokia keypad. So 4.444.8.44.88.22. means GITHUB.

STEP 4: When you type GITHUB as answer in the input box. You will get some ASCII codes. You dont have to do this manually. There is a hint to solve this smartly.
Its written Mr. Sherlock. Which is a ciphering technique. When you search Sherlock decipher and paste the code there. You will get the next link.

STEP 5: You have to find 4 things in this github repository. This 4 things will lead to you a pin-point location in college.
There are 3 branches in the repository. The ARCH branch has nothing.
In the ESB branch there is a commit named as "SILENCE PLEASE". If you open the commit and go to bingo.txt you will find LIBRARY.
So you get ESB and LIBRARY.
Then go to master -> commits. Observe the commit messages. 
You will find Saves You Serious Time Energy Money -> SYSTEM. That's the third one.
Now head over to tribbiani-bonacci commit in master. Go to getthenumber.txt. You will find a Tribonacci series. The missing number being 44.
So thats it run to ESB LIBRARY SYSTEM no. 44.
